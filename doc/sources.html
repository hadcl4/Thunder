<h1>Sources</h1>

<p>Sources are scripts to modify Thunder's functions. Through this guide we'll teach you how to use sources and create them. If you're a normal user (not a developer), refer to the "Importing Sources" section. Well, let's get started!</p>

<h2>Creating a Source</h2>

<p>You can create a source rather quickly. They're called "sources" because it's a source Thunder can refer to. Here we'll make a quick and simple source using Python. First off, you need to make a script to modify Thunder. Here's a simple one:
<code>
f.open("home/user/Thunder/config.cfg", "w") # Open Thunder's theme config file
f.write("darkgreen") # Replace the theme with darkgreen, one that Thunder doesn't have
f.close() # Then close the file
</code>
Then users can simply run in a terminal:
<code>
python3 my_source.py
</code>
And there! You got yourself a source! Now of course you can go more in depth than just changing the background to dark green, but this is just an example.</p>

<h2>Importing Sources</h2>

<p>For importing a source into Thunder, please refer to where you obtained the source. But, as an example for Python- and BASH-based sources, you might be able to run these commands in a terminal:</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p><code>
python3 sourcename.py
</code></p>

<h3>BASH</h3>

<p><code>
chmod +x sourcename.sh &amp;&amp; ./sourcename.sh
</code>
And there! You've now imported a source into Thunder!</p>
