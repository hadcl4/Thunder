<h1>Directory Structure</h1>

<p>Thunder's directory structure is discussed in this file. If you're not a developer interested in contributing to Thunder, and just a normal user, this file probably won't interest you. Well, let's get started!</p>

<h2>Assets</h2>

<p>Assets are stored in the base Thunder directory, located at ~/Thunder. Here is a diagram of the assets' location:
<code>
~/Thunder
--|logo.gif
--|logo.png
--|play.gif
--|setup.gif
--|up.png
--|down.png
</code>
The difference between <code>logo.png</code> and <code>logo.gif</code> is the .png file is the icon for the .desktop file. And the .gif file is used the Thunder app itself.</p>

<h2>Game Database</h2>

<p>Thunder features a built-in database of games. These include both setup scripts for games and covers. Here is its structure:
<code>
~/Thunder
--|database/
----|&lt;gamename&gt;.sh
----|&lt;gamename&gt;.gif
----|configs/
------|&lt;game configs&gt;
</code>
Thunder's database is by no means complete, but it features a large library to make setting up games easier.</p>

<h2>Program Files</h2>

<p>Here is the structure for Thunder's main files:
<code>
~/Thunder
--|main.py
--|mednafen.cfg
--|setup
--|start
--|thunder-cli
</code>
All of the files other than the <code>mednafen.cfg</code> are used directly in Thunder. The <code>mednafen.cfg</code> is copied during setup to Mednafen's folder.</p>

<h2>Markdown Files</h2>

<p>All the markdown files are in the base directory:
<code>
~/Thunder
--|Directory_Structure.md
--|HELP.md
--|LICENSE.md
--|README.md
--|SOURCES.md
</code></p>

<h2>Configuration Files</h2>

<p>The configuration files are a little scattered:
<code>
~/.thunder
--|config.cfg
--|page.cfg
--|library.cfg
--|default.txt
</code>
The .cfg files located in the <code>.thunder/</code> store the user's game library for a specific platform, and the <code>config.cfg</code> stores user settings (like the selected theme).</p>
